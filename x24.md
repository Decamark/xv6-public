Modify xv6 so that the pages for the kernel are shared among processes, which reduces memory consumption.

Both kernel and process use virtual address and they're mapped to physical addresses.

[`allocuvm()`](https://github.com/Decamark/xv6-public/blob/main/vm.c#L227) has a guard `newsz >= KERNBASE`. At this time, the page directory of the kernel `kpgdir` is used. If `newsz` is maliciously crafted and used in kernel space, it can ruin the kernel itself. And process itself is deployed to the kernel space.

Creates a new pgdir

In [`scheduler`](https://github.com/Decamark/xv6-public/blob/main/proc.c#L346), `swtch` changes the context to user-space. [`trapret`](https://github.com/Decamark/xv6-public/blob/14c9a28316dae2d197bcf9c8d947c835942c0cd2/trapasm.S#L25) will be called eventually and `iret` changes the mode to user-mode. After it returned, `switchkvm` switches to the kernel page table.

In any ways, we just need to remove `if(newsz >= KERNBASE)` check at [here](https://github.com/Decamark/xv6-public/blob/main/vm.c#L227).
